Research Interest
======
My primary research interests lie broadly in statistical genetics and bioinformatics. In particular, I am interested in application of cutting-edge technologies (e.g., sequencing technology) for analysis of high-throughput genetic and genomic data, and development of statistical and computational methods.
- Statistical method development in multi-omics data analysis
- Disease prediction using machine learning approaches (e.g., deep learning)
- Lung and Eye related diseases
